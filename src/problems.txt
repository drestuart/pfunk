I'm having a problem using pygame with PyDev in Eclipse which I can't find addressed elsewhere.

I have a very basic main.py like so:

    import pygame
    
    def main():
        print "main!"
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

`pygame` gets flagged as an unresolved import error.  When running this I get:

    /...Project folder.../src/main.py:9: RuntimeWarning: import threads: cannot import name time
    (ImportError: cannot import name time)
      import pygame
    main!

When I change the `import pygame` to `from pygame import *`, the editor no longer complains about the unresolved import, but I get the same error.  I can `import time` just fine.

Finally, using python from the command-line, I can `import pygame` with no problems.

Specs: I'm on Mac OS X 10.6.8, using Eclipse Indigo with Pydev.  This project and my pygame are using Python 2.7, and I've got pygame 1.9.1.  I've added the pygame folder to
